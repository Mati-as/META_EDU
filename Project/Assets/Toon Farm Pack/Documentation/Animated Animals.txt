The animals included in the pack are also animated.


		For convenience, some Animator Controllers have already been created. Drag & drop one corresponding controller in it's slot in 
the Animator window and enter playmode.
		Some of the controllers have different speed variants, in order to add the same animation to a group of animals, with a bit of variety.
The animals in the demo scenes already have some pre-loaded controllers, you can view them in action by entering playmode.
