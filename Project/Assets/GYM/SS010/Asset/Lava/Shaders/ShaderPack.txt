This free lava shader adds a dynamic and visually striking lava effect to your 3D environment. Designed for use in Unity, this shader simulates the glowing, flowing appearance of molten lava with realistic textures and animations.

Features:

Realistic Lava Flow: Simulates the movement and texture of flowing lava, including surface waves.
Dynamic Lighting: Includes glowing emissive properties to give the lava a realistic heat-based illumination.
Customizable Textures: Allows for adjustments to texture maps for color, intensity, and pattern variations.
Performance Optimized: Designed to run efficiently on a variety of hardware configurations, balancing visual fidelity with performance.
Easy Integration: Simple setup and integration into existing projects, with straightforward documentation to guide you through the process.
